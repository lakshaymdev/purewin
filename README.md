## Safety

PureWin is engineered with safety as the foundation:

### NEVER_DELETE Protection
Critical system paths are hardcoded as off-limits. PureWin will refuse to touch:
- `C:\Windows`
- `C:\Program Files`
- `C:\Program Files (x86)`
- User profile root directories

### Whitelist System
Protect specific caches you want to keep:
```bash
pw clean --whitelist
```
Whitelisted items are persisted in your config and skipped during cleanup.

### Dry-Run Mode
Preview exactly what will be deleted before committing:
```bash
pw clean --dry-run
```
Enable persistent dry-run mode in config:
```toml
# Edit %LOCALAPPDATA%\purewin\config.toml
dry_run = true
```

### Clear Confirmation Prompts
Every destructive operation requires explicit user confirmation with detailed previews. No surprises.
